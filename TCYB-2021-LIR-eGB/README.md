### Experiment
```
-Run kappa_N_S_exp_binary_stationary.py and kappa_N_S_exp_multi_stationary.py to get the results on stationary datasets.
-Run N_S_exp.py, re_N_S_exp.py, and sy_N_S_exp.py to get the results on nonstationary datasets.
```
### Datasets

- The datasets can be found [here](https://github.com/kunkun111/TCYB-LIR-eGB).
- The added MNIST dataset is download from: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
